Dynamic Transforms

To perform dynamic transforms, install these packages
- Xacro
- Joint State Publisher GUI
(Apparently installed in our method)

Note: URDF file consists of Links (rigid components) connected by joints (defines relationship between different components) 
This is similar to transforms as they consist of frames linked by transforms

A ROS node "robot_state_publisher" takes in a URDF file and broadcasts all the transforms from it.

Joints can be 
- Fixed (Static Transform)
- Continuous/Limited Rotation - Linear Motion (Dynamic Transform) (This needs real-time values) (/joint_states does the work)

/joint_states does the by taking real time values. But we will fake them using "joint_state_publisher_gui" 

- This will look at the robot description showed by robot_state_publisher, scan through the URDF, see which joints can be moved and show a slider for them, take the values of the slider and publish them as joint states	 

- "robot_state_publisher" takes the URDF file through "robot_description"

Step 1: Copy the example URDF file in your WSL environment. For this procedure, it was pasted in:

- \\wsl.localhost\Ubuntu-22.04\home\fatima

Step 2: Run the following commands:
- source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash

- ros2 run robot_state_publisher robot_state_publisher --ros-args -p robot_description:="$(xacro /home/fatima/example_robot.urdf.xacro)"

Step 3: New command window and run this:

- ros2 run joint_state_publisher_gui joint_state_publisher_gui

Step 4: Launch rvis2 in another command line

Step 5: Since the example URDF file has a robot model. You can view it by "Add" + "RobotModel", set the Description Topic to "/robot_description"

TO DEBUGG: ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames.py
(To make a PDF of frames)

- If this doesn't work, follow steps:
1. Manually install tf2_tools
- sudo apt-get install ros-humble-tf2-tools
2. Check script path
- ros2 pkg prefix tf2_tools
3. Find the location of the file:
- find / -name view_frames.py 2>/dev/null
4. Run the python script using the location provided
python3 /opt/ros/humble/lib/python3.10/site-packages/tf2_tools/view_frames.py
